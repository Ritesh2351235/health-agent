- Each time block should have 2-4 tasks with specific reasoning based on BOTH health data AND behavioral analysis
- Base all recommendations on BOTH health analysis AND behavioral analysis
- Make routines practical and sustainable based on behavioral barriers and drivers

Remember: You are creating a personalized lifestyle intervention based on real health data AND comprehensive behavioral psychology analysis. The routine must be both health-optimized AND behaviorally sustainable while reflecting your specific archetype's approach and philosophy.
